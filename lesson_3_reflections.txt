Q: What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing 
   merges manually?

A: Pro:: Automatic merging saves people time and hassle whenever merging is
   for non-overlapping sections of the code. 

   Cons:: Merging does not take into account the functionality of the code,
   so it is possible that some of the automatic merges cause a loss in 
   functionality. Merging automatically is not always seemless in the
   sense that there can be conflicts, which need to be manually resolved.
