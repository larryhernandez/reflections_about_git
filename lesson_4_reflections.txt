Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A: Remote repositories are useful for collaborating with other people who have cloned copies
of the repository to their computers. This is particularly useful for open source projects
that could include tens or hundreds of people working on various aspects of a large project. 
Remote repositories are also useful for an individual who is working on a project using 
multiple computers.
