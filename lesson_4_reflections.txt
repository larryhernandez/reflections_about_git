Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A: Remote repositories are useful for collaborating with other people who 
have cloned copies of the repository to their computers. This is 
particularly useful for open source projects that could include tens or 
hundreds of people working on various aspects of a large project. Remote 
repositories are also useful for an individual who is working on a project 
using multiple computers.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: Having Git automatically stay up-to-date with the remote repository can
introduce unwanted changes in a local branch which has been created to 
experiment with a new feature or generally interfere with the functionality 
of a local branch. Manually updating repositories gives the owner of the 
local repository full control of which changes to incorporate. Also, 
automatic updates may not be completely possible anyway since it's common 
for two branches to introduce changes to the same section of code within 
the master branch, creating "merge conflicts" which would require 
resolution to be performed manually.
